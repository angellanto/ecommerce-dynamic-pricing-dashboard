### Business Intelligence | Team Assignment Grade: 100/100 
### Professor Comment: 
Thank you Team 4 for your submission, well done!

Very impressive dashboard developed with React/JS in the e-commerce space

Great job including content from the last lecture (e.g., tactical, strategic dashboards) where the importance of UX has been discussed

Deep dive into the BI architecture, very valuable

Areas of improvement

At the comparison of the traditional and ai-powered BI (Table 1) include the risks or further elements which enhances the comparison, especially at the AI part when different types of stakeholders interact with it
### Assignment Instructions: 
Task: Compare Traditional BI vs. AI-Powered BI

Your team will compare traditional BI (dashboard-driven analytics) vs. AI-powered BI (automated & real-time insights)

Traditional BI:
- Relies on static dashboards, SQL-based querying, and pre-defined reports
- Often requires manual data preparation and transformation
- Used for historical data analysis rather than predictions

AI-Driven BI:
- Uses machine learning & natural language processing for automated insights
- Predicts trends and anomalies before they happen
- Can automate decision-making in real-time rather than just reporting past trends

Deliverable:

Comparative analysis summarizing key differences in a side-by-side table format

Focus on a real-world scenario, analyzing both the potential benefits and limitations of the selected AI-powered BI solutions within the context of your case study.

Task: Propose an AI-Driven BI Solution

Your team will design a new BI system that leverages AI and real-time analytics to solve a specific business problem

1. Define the Problem:
You should identify a business challenge that AI-powered BI can solve, such as:
- Retail: Real-time customer behavior tracking for instant price adjustments
- Healthcare: AI-based hospital resource allocation to optimize ICU bed management
- Finance: AI-driven automated fraud detection and prevention alerts
- E-commerce: AI-driven chatbot that provides real-time analytics to business owners

2. Design the AI-Powered BI Solution:
- What data sources will be used? (Real-time transaction data, IoT, CRM, social media, etc.)
- What AI technologies will be integrated? (Machine Learning, NLP, predictive modeling)
- How will insights be delivered? (Automated alerts, chatbot, interactive AI-driven dashboard)
- How does it improve decision-making?

3. Create a Visual Mock-Up:
- A wireframe or diagram of the BI solutionâ€™s interface.
- If using Tableau, students can create a prototype dashboard with AI-driven features.
- If not using Tableau, students can create a PowerPoint, Figma, or Miro board to present their concept.

Deliverable:
- The business challenge and why AI is needed
- A detailed overview of the AI-powered BI solution
- Expected impact and business benefits
- Visual Mock-Up of the AI-Driven BI System (Sketch, Wireframe, Tableau Prototype, or Flowchart)

Focus on a real-world scenario, analyzing both the potential benefits and limitations of the selected AI-powered BI solutions within the context of your case study.
